# Product Requirements Document (PRD): IvyLink

## App Overview

IvyLink, is an AI-powered web application built to help students craft highly personalized college application essays. The app provides detailed, school-specific feedback by analyzing a student's personal statement and tailoring it to each institution's unique values and expectations. Users can generate multiple essay versions for different colleges, get tone suggestions, rewrite prompts, and even request optional human feedback. The ultimate goal is to empower students to tell their story in a compelling way that resonates with each university's admissions criteria.

## User Flow

Users begin their journey on the landing page, where they are introduced to AI EssayCoach through a clean and compelling layout. The landing page contains a brief overview, testimonials, and a call-to-action prompting users to sign up or log in.

After signing up or logging in, users are directed to the dashboard. Here, they can upload their main personal statement. They are then asked to select the colleges they are applying to from a searchable list.

Once the college list is finalized, the platform processes the uploaded essay and generates tailored versions for each institution. Users are then taken to an editing interface where they can view their base essay and toggle between the forked versions. For each version, line-by-line feedback is presented alongside rewrite suggestions and tone alignment based on the chosen school's preferences.

If users want more insight, they can choose to request human feedback, which can be done through an integrated payment and booking system. After receiving AI and/or human feedback, users can revise their essays using the built-in editor and finally export their polished drafts.

### Icons:

- Use **FontAwesome** icons for common actions (edit, save, export)
- Custom SVG icons for essay tone indicators (e.g., lightbulb for ideas, flag for tone alerts)
- Consistent icon sizing and spacing to maintain a harmonious UI

The frontend should feel modern, student-friendly, and polishedâ€”balancing form and function to support essay creation without overwhelming the user.
